# TL's Yelp Challeng
Author: Maggie Moreno

## The Ask

Please build a simple single-page web app that helps a user find businesses around a give address/location. The user should be able to input an address and a topic, and the app should display a list of results and their locations plotted on a map. In reviewing your work, our focus will be on your code, not the beauty of your app. Feel free to use Bootstrap or any other front-end design library to make your app usable, but please don't stress about the aesthetics.
